# Assessing the Effectiveness of Medical Treatments: Logistic Regression and Kidney Stones

I completed this project through DataCamp using R.

### Abstract
"In 1986, a group of urologists in London published a research paper in The British Medical Journal that compared the effectiveness of two different methods to remove kidney stones. Treatment A was open surgery (invasive), and treatment B was percutaneous nephrolithotomy (less invasive). When they looked at the results from 700 patients, treatment B had a higher success rate. However, when they only looked at the subgroup of patients different kidney stone sizes, treatment A had a better success rate. What is going on here? This known statistical phenomenon is called Simponâ€™s paradox. Simpon's paradox occurs when trends appear in subgroups but disappear or reverse when subgroups are combined."

This projects investigates the significance of two treatments and the sizes of the kidney stones using multiple logistic regression.
